## LightOS
LightOS is a program launcher thing I made. It also has Chatpy. 
___
All the launchers will launch LightOS in debug mode, unless in a stable release. For testing purposes, set the "release" variable in LightOS.py to True to launch LightOS as a release. Set the "logging" variable to True to enable console logging.
___
note to me: change release to True for a release, and remove the debug menu + debug logs for a release. also change version number in settings.
